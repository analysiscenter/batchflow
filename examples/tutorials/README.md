# Hello and welcome to BatchFlow tutorials!

These tutorials are intended to help you obtain a good working knowledge of how to use BatchFlow library. Start slow without rush and soon you'll be able to create flexible machine learning pipelines.

1. [Batch operations](./01_batch_operations.ipynb) — a short guide on how to obtain a batch flow.
2. [Pipeline operations](./02_pipeline_operations.ipynb) — pipelines how to.
3. [Train a ready to use TensorFlow model](./03_ready_to_use_model_tf.ipynb).
A fast intro into how to create and train ready to use models like ResNet, VGG and [many others](https://analysiscenter.github.io/batchflow/intro/model_zoo_tf.html).
   [Train a ready to use PyTorch model](./03_ready_to_use_model_torch.ipynb).
A fast intro into how to create and train ready to use models like ResNet, VGG and [many others](https://analysiscenter.github.io/batchflow/intro/model_zoo_torch.html).
4. [Linear models as an example](./04_linear_models_example.ipynb) — a longer immersion into models training and configuration.
5. [Creating your own model](./05_creating_CNN.ipynb). This tutorial shows how to create and train a simple model to recognize the digits from MNIST database.
6. [Working with images](./06_image_augmentation.ipynb). How to augment images with ImagesBatch actions.
7. [Sampling](./07_sampler.ipynb). How to sampling of multivariate distributions.

Next you might want some more tutorials.

* [Research](./research). Research module tutorials.
* [Advance model config](./advance_model_config). Tutorials on model configuration options.

Also you might be interested in [the experiments](./../experiments/experiments.ipynb).
